        "1. What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
        "\n",
        "OOP is a programming paradigm based on the concept of \"objects,\" which can contain data (attributes) and code (methods) that operate on that data. It promotes modularity, code reusability, and maintainability.\n",
        "2. What is a class in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "A class is a blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines the attributes and methods that objects of that class will have.\n",
        "3. What is an object in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "An object is an instance of a class. It represents a specific entity with its own set of attributes and behaviors defined by the class.\n",
        "4. What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?\n",
        "\n",
        "Abstraction: Focusing on the essential features of an object while hiding the unnecessary details. For example, you can use a car without knowing its internal mechanics.\n",
        "Encapsulation: Wrapping data and methods that operate on that data within a single unit (the class), protecting the data from unauthorized access or modification.\n",
        "5. What are dunder methods in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Dunder methods (also known as magic methods) are special methods in Python that start and end with double underscores (e.g., _init, __str_). They provide a way to customize how objects behave in certain situations (e.g., initialization, string representation).\n",
        "6. Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP.\n",
        "\n",
        "Inheritance allows you to create new classes (subclasses) from existing ones (superclasses). Subclasses inherit the attributes and methods of the superclass, and can also have their own unique properties.\n",
        "7. What is polymorphism in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "Polymorphism means \"many forms.\" It allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common type. For example, different shapes can all have a method to calculate their area, even though the implementation of that method will differ.\n",
        "8. How is encapsulation achieved in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Encapsulation is achieved by using access modifiers (public, private, protected) to control the visibility of class attributes and methods. By default, attributes and methods are public. You can make them private by prefixing them with a double underscore ().\n",
        "9. What is a constructor in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "A constructor is a special method in a class that is automatically called when an object of that class is created. It is typically used to initialize the object's attributes. In Python, the constructor method is named _init_.\n",
        "10. What are class and static methods in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Class methods: Are bound to the class, not the object. They can be called on the class itself or on any object of that class. They are decorated with the @classmethod decorator.\n",
        "Static methods: Are not bound to the class or the object. They are simply functions that are defined within a class. They are decorated with the @staticmethod decorator.\n",
        "11. What is method overloading in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Python doesn't support method overloading in the traditional sense (defining multiple methods with the same name but different parameters). However, you can achieve similar behavior using default arguments or variable-length arguments.\n",
        "12. What is method overriding in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "Method overriding occurs when a subclass provides its own implementation for a method that is already defined in its superclass. This allows the subclass to customize the behavior of the inherited method.\n",
        "13. What is a property decorator in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "The @property decorator allows you to define methods that can be accessed like attributes. It provides a way to control access to and modify attributes in a more object-oriented way.\n",
        "14. Why is polymorphism important in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "Polymorphism makes code more flexible, reusable, and easier to maintain. It allows you to write generic code that can work with objects of different classes, as long as they share a common interface.\n",
        "15. What is an abstract class in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "An abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated directly. It contains one or more abstract methods, which are methods that are declared but have no implementation. Subclasses of an abstract class must provide implementations for all abstract methods.\n",
        "16. What are the advantages of OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "Modularity\n",
        "Code Reusability\n",
        "Maintainability\n",
        "Flexibility\n",
        "Data Abstraction and Encapsulation\n",
        "17. What is the difference between a class variable and an instance variable?\n",
        "\n",
        "Class variable: Belongs to the class itself and is shared by all instances of that class.\n",
        "Instance variable: Belongs to a specific instance of a class and stores data unique to that object.\n",
        "18. What is multiple inheritance in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Multiple inheritance is a feature where a class can inherit from multiple parent classes. This allows you to create complex class hierarchies.\n",
        "19. Explain the purpose of the _str_ and _repr_ methods in Python.\n",
        "\n",
        "_str_ is used to define how an object should be represented as a human-readable string.\n",
        "_repr_ is used to define how an object should be represented in a way that can be used to recreate the object.\n",
        "20. What is the significance of the super() function in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "The super() function is used to call the parent class's constructor or other methods from within a child class. It helps to avoid issues in multiple inheritance scenarios.\n",
        "21. What is the significance of the _del_ method in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "The _del_ method, also known as the destructor, is called when an object is about to be garbage collected. It can be used to perform cleanup operations before the object is destroyed.\n",
        "22. What is the difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "@staticmethod: Not bound to the class or the object. Can be called on the class or any object of that class.\n",
        "@classmethod: Bound to the class, not the object. Can be called on the class or any object of that class. It receives the class itself as the first argument.\n",
        "23. How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance?\n",
        "\n",
        "Polymorphism allows you to treat objects of different classes that share a common superclass in a uniform way. For example, if you have a list of objects that are instances of different subclasses, you can call a method on each object without knowing its exact class, as long as that method is defined in the superclass.\n",
        "24. What is method chaining in Python OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "Method chaining is a way to call multiple methods on an object in a single line of code. For example, obj.method1().method2().method3().\n",
        "25. What is the purpose of the _call_ method in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "The _call_ method allows you to make an object callable, meaning you can treat it like a function. When you call an object with parentheses, Python internally calls the _call_ method of that object."
